# Capstone Project Server

# Deploy

This app has been built and tested on ubuntu server 18.04.
This is the only supported platform, however any linux distribution with git, nginx, and the required python and django packages should work.
To understand the install process please refer to the install script setup.py.

To deploy the app on a fresh install of ubuntu 18.04:

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/federation-capstone-project/ProjectServer.git && cd ProjectServer
chmod +x setup.py
sudo ./setup.py
```

The app's install directory can be found at `/var/www/html/capstoneserver` this directory can be edited by root or any user on the www-data group.
The setup script will create a user called django inside this group.

# Configuration

You can prepopulate the database with JSON data generated by another application or DB.
These JSON files are called fixtures.
You can find example JSON files in the `demo_fixtures` directory.
There is a web administration interface at `http://<domain/ip>/admin/` the default admin account is called administrator and the password is configured during installation.

# Web Interface

The first step to configuring the app is to create the config table in the app.

# API Endpoints and Server Testing

The server has a number of endpoints that can be accessed using curl or a web browser using the browsable API system from django rest framework.

# Development

There are a few key key files to check if you wish to extend the app.

* `models.py` This is where the database definitions and models are stored, by editing models and their serializers new data can be added to endpoints.
* `urls.py` This is where the web API is defined as a list of url patterns that connect the API to the webserver.
* `views.py` This is where model views are coded, these are the connection between models and the API and where access controls are implemented.

The app can be run on localhost from the app directory for development purposes, the process is

# Changing server backend

By default the server uses a local SQLite database and this is what our server has been tested against for ease and simplicity, it may be that other backends are required. Our server app is simple enough that changing the DB should be as easy as changing a few lines of code, but this is untested and unsupported so your mileage may vary.
