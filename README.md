# Capstone Project Server

# Deploy

This app has been built and tested on ubuntu server 18.04.
This is the only supported platform, however any linux distribution with git, nginx, and the required python and django packages should work.
To understand the install process please refer to the install script setup.py.

To deploy the app on a fresh install of ubuntu 18.04:

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/federation-capstone-project/ProjectServer.git && cd ProjectServer
./setup.py
```

The app's install directory can be found at `/var/www/html/capstoneserver` this directory can be edited by root or any user on the www-data group.
The setup script will create a user called django inside this group.

# Configuration

You can prepopulate the database with JSON data generated by another application or DB.
These JSON files are called fixtures.
You can find example JSON files in the demo_fixtures directory.
There is a web administration interface at `http://<domain/ip>/admin/` the default admin account is called administrator and the password is configured during installation.

# Web Interface

The first step to configuring the app is to create the config table in the app.
